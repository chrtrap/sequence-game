# Sequence Game

## Description

This project is a digital adaptation of the board game **Sequence**. It allows you to play against a computer opponent through an intuitive graphical interface built with Python and Pygame. The game features a computer opponent designed to offer a challenging single-player experience.

## Installation

To set up and play the Sequence game on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chrtrap/sequence-game.git

1.  **Navigate to the Project Directory**:


    ```bash
    cd sequence-game

2.  **Install the Required Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed. Install the necessary libraries using pip:

    ```bash
   pip install itertools numpy pygame

3.  **Run the Game**: Execute the `sequence_game.py` file to start the game:


    ```bash
   python sequence_game.py

Usage
-----

To play the game:

- **Select a Card**: Click on a card from your hand to play it.
- **Place a Chip**: Choose one of the valid spaces on the board to place your chip.
- **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The game will guide you through the moves and actions you can take.
- **Winning the Game**: The objective is to form two sequences of five consecutive chips on the board. The first player to achieve this wins the game.
- **Computer Opponent**: The computer will automatically take its turn after you.
